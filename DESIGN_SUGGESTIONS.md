# Modern Design Suggestions

This document outlines ideas for enhancing the website using modern web development techniques while preserving the existing green and gold aesthetic.

## 1. Emphasize the Brand Colors
- Configure custom DaisyUI theme in `tailwind.config.js` with brand shades of green and gold.
- Maintain high contrast for readability; keep the palette minimal so the content stands out.

## 2. Subtle Geometric Backgrounds
- Use lightweight SVGs or CSS `radial-gradient` backgrounds with very low opacity.
- Simple geometry (concentric circles, soft polygons) can be layered with CSS to give depth while staying unobtrusive.
- Consider generating patterns offline (e.g. with MidJourney) and exporting as optimized SVG.

## 3. Modern Layout Techniques
- Leverage CSS Grid for layout structure and Flexbox for component alignment.
- Keep generous whitespace and use a single-column layout for readability on desktop and mobile.

## 4. Microâ€‘interactions and Animation
- Use Tailwind transitions for links and buttons (opacity, color, scale) to provide polished feedback.
- Keep animations under 250ms so they feel snappy and do not distract from the text.

## 5. Performance and Accessibility
- Use `next/dynamic` to code-split heavy components.
- Ensure color choices meet accessibility contrast ratios.
- Continue using semantic HTML for screen readers.

## Example Snippet
```tsx
// tailwind.config.js (extend DaisyUI theme)
module.exports = {
  daisyui: {
    themes: [
      {
        mytheme: {
          primary: '#0d662d',   // dark green
          secondary: '#d4af37', // subtle gold
          accent: '#ffffff',
          neutral: '#1a1a1a',
        },
      },
    ],
    darkTheme: 'mytheme',
  },
};
```

This configuration keeps the color scheme consistent while allowing subtle design enhancements across components.
