# The Craft

An occasional podcast where [Michael Du](https://www.youtube.com/@cryptotrix) and I interview experts in various fields to learn about their disciplines and how they strive toward mastery. Find us on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thecraftpodcast) or subscribe to the [podcast feed](https://anchor.fm/the-craft-podcast).

## Why?

We love talking to people who are passionate enough to master something. We’ve each been asking curious questions of these craftspeople our whole lives, and want to share those conversations with others. We have no business plan, expectations of a large following, or desire for this to be anything other than a personal project of passion.

## What’s the format?

A minimally-edited one-on-one video interview (in the vein of [EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org/) or [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/)).
