# Blockchain

I was really into blockchain technology back in 2022, and still believe it will be an important balance against the coming flood of AI-generated everything.

*Written in 2022.*

Are you new to blockchain? I've wasted many hours over many months reading lots of crap. If it's helpful in saving you some time, here are my top recommendations:

## General Blockchain and Web3

1. By far, my number one recommendation for those who are new to the concepts:  [MIT Opencourseware Blockchain and Money course, taught by Gary Gensler](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/). Gary's not only super influential in the space (a la being U.S. SEC Chair), but he's also a very good teacher and really dove deep to lead a great class.
2. Don't forget to read the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) white papers!
3. Most blockchain projects today are just defi projects in disguise, so it's good to get a basic understanding of defi as well:  [DeFi Beyond the Hype](https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf)

### My attempts to define key terms in a way my grandmothers would understand

- Blockchain/web3:  private property on the internet
- Metaverse:  3d internet
- DAO:  A Facebook group with it's own money and people can vote to change the rules

### Good news sources

- [The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/):  Quality daily newsletter that gets to the point.
- [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/):  Also a good daily market summary newsletter.
- [The Information's Crypto newsletter](https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/crypto-global)
- [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/):  They're a data provider, but they send out thoughtful weekly analysis of the crypto environment.
- [Bankless](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/):  Interesting podcast, but extremely biased towards their crypto-utopian vision of the world. The ads are interesting.
- [The Tim Ferriss podcast](https://tim.blog/) features some great episodes with people who I think are well-versed on the broader potential social and economic implications of blockchain applications, namely those episodes with Naval Ravikant, Tim Dixon, and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.

### Data sources

- [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) (good idea, but sketchy data)

### Best Resources for Introduction to the Space

Keep in mind:  None of the "models" for blockchain games are proven or sustainable yet. These are all experiments.
