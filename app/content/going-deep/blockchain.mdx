# Blockchain

I was really into blockchain technology back in 2022, and still believe it will be an important balance against the coming flood of AI-generated everything.

*Written in 2022.*

Are you new to blockchain? I've wasted many hours over many months reading lots of crap. If it's helpful in saving you some time, here are my top recommendations:

## General Blockchain and Web3

1. By far, my number one recommendation for those who are new to the concepts:  [MIT Opencourseware Blockchain and Money course, taught by Gary Gensler](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/). Gary's not only super influential in the space (a la being U.S. SEC Chair), but he's also a very good teacher and really dove deep to lead a great class.
2. Don't forget to read the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) white papers!
3. Most blockchain projects today are just defi projects in disguise, so it's good to get a basic understanding of defi as well:  [DeFi Beyond the Hype](https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf)

### My attempts to define key terms in a way my grandmothers would understand

- Blockchain/web3:  private property on the internet
- Metaverse:  3d internet
- DAO:  A Facebook group with it's own money and people can vote to change the rules

- [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/):  Also a good daily market summary newsletter.
- [The Information's Crypto newsletter](https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/crypto-global)
- [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/):  They're a data provider, but they send out thoughtful weekly analysis of the crypto environment.
- [Bankless](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/):  Interesting podcast, but extremely biased towards their crypto-utopian vision of the world. The ads are interesting.
- [The Tim Ferriss podcast](https://tim.blog/) features some great episodes with people who I think are well-versed on the broader potential social and economic implications of blockchain applications, namely those episodes with Naval Ravikant, Tim Dixon, and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.

### Best Resources for Introduction to the Space

Keep in mind:  None of the "models" for blockchain games are proven or sustainable yet. These are all experiments.

## DAO Resources - August 2022


### Starting points

I think we have a huge leg up after building volunteer organizations from scratch, because a lot of the setup feels similar:  getting work done in an org that is extremely egalitarian and community-driven, where roles (and even membership itself!) are extremely fluid, and reputation must be built up over time. That said, DAOs today mix in those elements with a lot of technology and organizational baggage that feels foreign.


### The best overview

I would start with the [How to DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jxbb3YkrjAT1TUe6W2yCFUAsXUhdVt5JYoJwmMfykoQ/edit) course notes. It places DAOs in an interesting historical context but also carries through to implementation styles and challenges today. I was so taken with the doc that I invited the author, [Stephen Reid](https://stephenreid.net/), to come speak at my work.


### Keep up with the latest

Next, there are a few folks who I think are thinking very deeply about the challenges for DAOs and frequently share what they're learning and interview others in the space:

* Kevin Owocki's Green Pill podcast – [here's a good example](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/34-evolutionary-daos-with-chase-chapman/id1609313639?i=1000575504990) 
* [The Ownership Economy](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ownership-economy/id1609220378) podcast
* [Brave New Work](https://www.bravenewwork.com/podcast) podcast

Follow these and you’ll quickly be talking the talk of socialware versus trustware, crafting lore, identifying schelling points, and all the other buzzwords.

### Two Projects I like, as of August 2022

You asked for specific projects to learn from. I’m unimpressed with the vast majority of DAOs I encounter and many others I just don’t know well enough to comment. Of the groups I’ve seen, these two have given me the best impression:

* **[Ethereum Cat Herders](https://www.ethereumcatherders.com)** - This group manages the EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) process to create standards for the Ethereum ecosystem. While not a DAO in the typical sense (it's mostly off-chain activity), I think they've done a fantastic job at being welcoming & transparent, functioning effectively without a lot of money, and perceived as quite neutral.
* **[Gitcoin’s governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/c/governancevision/6)** - The way they’ve set up their forum, do everything in a transparent and open way, and have a robust and diverse community of leaders in the DAO makes me admire how they’re built it. Kevin’s an ESGDAO adviser, so you can get more pointed background from him.

### Voting and Reputation

You asked specifically about these two topics. I don't think voting and reputation are solved yet for large groups. Gitcoin is probably the closest that I know of. Most DAOs today are still just plutocracies with a veneer of open participation.

Two DAO governance protocols that I think tackle these issues in interesting ways are:

* [Orca Protocol](https://docs.orcaprotocol.org) – breaks everything up into “pods”, sub-groups that have authority in a particular area.
* [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club) and the [Moloch DAO framework](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/U_JQtheSzdpRFqQwf9Ow3LgLNG0WMZ6ibAyrjWDu_fc) – offers deep customization and solutions for things like non-tradable voting tokens.

I also have a proposal for a standard protocol for reputation that’s under review by Ethereum community:  [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4974](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4974). Eventually, this or another standard, could be a de facto way for people to develop reputations and keep them consistent across ecosystems.

### Getting started

I started thinking about what are the minimum-required building blocks to set up a functioning DAO and came up with this messy, off-the-cuff list:

#### Off-chain basics

* **Public forum** for discussion that is NOT an instant messenger. I like Discourse.
* **Regular calls** -- open agendas, public recordings, and publicly share any notes or decisions
* **Can you track everything in a spreadsheet before going on-chain?** Why wouldn’t you start with that?
* **Onboarding process** for new community members

(Discord and Telegram are standard, although I doubt how useful they actually are for running a DAO)


#### On-chain basics

* **Membership digital asset** that offer access/influence of some kind
* **A system to manage members** – who has membership and what power each digital asset grants
* **Decision-making mechanism** (it doesn’t need to be voting and staking like we see today)
* **Receiving and making payments** (the most legally complex)

Each building block already has several well-funded startups offering implementations. The links in the next section are the best compilation I’ve seen of all the different tools.

### Kitchen Sink Resources

If you want to go very deep down the rabbit hole:

* [DAOstar](https://daostar.org/) is a collective of DAOs working together for interoperability. By my estimation, the group consists of the most long-term-oriented DAOs.
* [Metagov](https://metagov.org/) is a group of researchers producing research and collecting resources about the future of governance and community. While not strictly about DAOs, it's right up the alley of what interests us.
* [Giant spreadsheet](https://airtable.com/shrgnUrj0dqzZDsOd/tblvk3EFzcoCFvXXi/viwTisATNcua7os4y) of all the DAOs, tools, and relevant projects you can think of
* Good, but increasingly outdated, [a16z DAO Canon](https://future.com/dao-canon), with myriad articles about DAOs
