# How I Made This Website

## The Philosophy

I'm lazy, so I made this extremely simple.

I wanted three things:
1. **Easy content editing** - Just write Markdown files, no build steps to think about
2. **React when needed** - Drop in custom components for interactive features
3. **Straightforward deployment** - Modern hosting with static generation

Much simpler markdown rendering solutions exist, but this setup bridges markdown simplicity with React flexibility and Next.js deployment convenience.

## The Stack

This site uses:

- **[Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)** - React framework with App Router
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** - Markdown + JSX for content files
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first styling
- **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)** - Component library for consistent design
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** - Animation library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety

## How It Works

### File-Based Routing

The magic is simple: **the folder structure becomes the URL path**.

```
app/content/index.mdx → /
app/content/about.mdx → /about
app/content/going-deep/ai.mdx → /going-deep/ai
```

A single dynamic route handler (`app/[...slug]/page.tsx`) imports the corresponding MDX file and renders it. That's it.

### Content Creation

To add a new page, I just create a `.mdx` file:

```mdx
# My New Page

This is content. **Markdown works**.

I can also use React components when needed.
```

### React Components

When I need interactivity, I create components in `components/` and import them:

```mdx
import ScrambleHover from '@/components/ScrambleHover'

<ScrambleHover text="Daniel Tedesco" />
```

This site has custom components for things like:
- Animated text effects (ScrambleHover)
- Conway's Game of Life visualization
- Web projects gallery
- Art Deco background effects

## The Template

I created a minimal boilerplate that handles the core functionality, so I could reuse it for future projects:

**[nextjs-markdown-boilerplate](https://github.com/dtedesco1/nextjs-markdown-boilerplate)**

It's intentionally minimal - just the essentials for markdown-to-page conversion with optional React integration. No bloat.

## This Site

The full source code for this website is open source:

**[dtedes.co on GitHub](https://github.com/dtedesco1/dtedes.co)**

It builds on the boilerplate with:
- Custom components for interactive features
- DaisyUI theme customization
- Art Deco visual styling
- Web projects API endpoint
- Personal content organization

## Why This Approach?

**Separation of concerns**: Content lives in simple `.mdx` files that anyone can edit. Code lives in components. The routing system connects them automatically.

**No mental overhead**: I don't think about build processes or CMS systems. I just write markdown files and they become pages.

**Future-proof**: It's just files in folders. If I want to migrate to another system someday, my content is already in portable markdown format.

**Flexible**: Need a static page? Write markdown. Need interactivity? Add a React component. The system adapts to the content, not the other way around.

## Getting Started

If you want to build something similar:

1. Clone the [boilerplate](https://github.com/dtedesco1/nextjs-markdown-boilerplate)
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Start writing `.mdx` files in `app/content/`
4. Run `npm run dev` to see your site

That's it. No complex setup, no configuration hell. Just write and deploy.
