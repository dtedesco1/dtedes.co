# Life Plan Summary 2024-02

My life plan is a living document that I use to guide my life. It is centered on my personal vision, a single-sentence summary of who I aim to be.

## Vision

A child of God who loves all, makes a living bringing joy to the world with technology, and explores the universe through art and learning.

### Components

- **child of God**: Not merely a "believer" with such a label, but someone who has a deep and personal relationship with God and seeks to live a life of love and service to others.
- **loves all**: Love is the first verb in the vision. It's not a state, as relationships require proactive effort over time. Love does not mean giving everyone what they want, but it does mean giving respect, honesty, and mercy even when its difficult.
- **makes a living**: Work funds pursuit of the vision to its fullest. Volunteering time and resources can show love, but they are not the entirety of the vision.
- **bringing joy to the world with technology**: Technology is a powerful tool that can bring joy to the world. It is not an end in itself.
- **explores the universe through art and learning**: I find the universe endlessly beautiful. I seek to traverse it through art and learning. It is not a place to be conquered.

## Missions

Missions are the specific goals that I have set for myself. They are the building blocks to my vision.

### Foundation

- **Faith**: Build a strong relationship with God
- **Marriage**: Cherish and enjoy life with Flora
- **Friends**: Cultivate friendships, staying open to new and old, straightforward and challenging
- **Health**: Invigorate yourself with the fitness regimen of an athlete, a diet and sleep schedule that make you feel great, and excellent organization and cleanliness

### Work

- **Economics**: Make enough money to fund your vision, seeking paid work that aligns with your goals
- **Ties**: Deepen your professional network in technology and widen it to more fields
- **Experiments**: Make small bets of time and money, exposing yourself to new and forward-looking arenas that could graduate to "economics" goals

### Wonder

- **Expression**: Make music and write daily, even if it's just a few minutes and just for yourself
- **Learning**: Spend significant time exploring disciplines and places that excite you and when no practical application exists
