# Life Plan 2025-11

This is a living document that I use to guide my life. It is centered on my personal vision, a single-sentence summary of who I aim to be.

## Vision

A child of God who loves generously, makes a living bringing joy to the world with technology, and explores the universe through art and learning.

### Components

- **child of God**: Not a believer with a label, but someone who has a deep, humble, and ever-present relationship with the ["source of all we hope or dread"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4mspGeMQumiTR3u46ySXRf).
- **loves generously**: The first verb in my vision. Love not a state; relationships require effort. Loving generously does not mean giving everyone what they want, but it does mean offering respect and kindness even when I don't feel like it and when the other person doesn't deserve it.
- **makes a living**: Work funds pursuit of the vision to its fullest. Volunteering time and resources can show love, but they are not the entirety of the vision.
- **bringing joy to the world with technology**: Technology is a powerful tool that should enrich life and community. It is not an end in itself.
- **explores the universe through art and learning**: Creation is endlessly beautiful, and though we constantly grasp for more, we already have access to more of it than we can handle. I seek to traverse a modicum of that beauty by experiencing it (art) and trying to understand (learning) some of that beauty. It is not a place to be conquered.

## Missions

Missions are the specific goals that I have set for myself. They are the building blocks to my vision.

### Foundation

- **Faith**: Build a strong relationship with God
- **Marriage**: Cherish and enjoy life with Flora
- **Friends**: Cultivate friendships, staying open to new and old, straightforward and challenging
- **Health**: Invigorate yourself with the fitness regimen of an athlete, a diet and sleep schedule that make you feel great, and excellent organization and cleanliness

### Work

- **Economics**: Make money to fund your vision, without compromising it along the way
- **Ties**: Deepen your professional network in technology and widen it to ever more fields
- **Experiments**: Make small bets of time and money, exposing yourself to new and forward-looking arenas that can graduate to "economics" goals

### Wonder

- **Expression**: Make music and write daily, even if it's just a few minutes and just for yourself
- **Learning**: Spend significant time exploring disciplines and places that excite you and when no practical application exists
